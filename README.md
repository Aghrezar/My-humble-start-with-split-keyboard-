So first of all, this would be a hand wired keyboard inspired by Lily58 keyboard.

I am on a strict budget, so no pcb for me. And I don't like rgbled's.

I'll 3D the shell and maybe make the keyboard hotswapadle as well.

Hotswap sockets would be 3d printed too.

parts required:

* 2x arduino pro micro (atmega32u4 usb-c)
* 2x TRS sockets
* 58x diodes
* 2x oled's (128 x 32 SSD1306)
* 2x 3D printed shells (need to design my own it seams)
* key caps
* bits and bobs (screws, solder, wire...)
